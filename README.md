# pokemon-teambuilder

This repository contains all code for my automated pokemon teambuilder project. Descriptions of individual files will be added as new files are created.

readTeamSyntax - contains the parseTeam function, which reads teams in the text format provided by Pokemon Showdown or PokePaste and returns it in dictionary form.

scrapePokedex - contains the scrollPage and scrapeDex functions, which use Selenium webdrivers to populate a competitivePokedex.csv file. This file contains several details key to deriving semantic concepts within competitive Pokemon teams.
